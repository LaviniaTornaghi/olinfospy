# olinfospy
This is some code that i wrote to keep track of my friends' progress on the italian training.olinfo.it website.

Olinfospy asks for a username and then asks the API of training the informations about the user, it has a mini-database (utenti.txt) in which the list of problems solved by the users you already asked about is memorized, so that when the user asks about the same username it shows the new tasks solved.
